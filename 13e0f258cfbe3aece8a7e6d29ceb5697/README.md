# Dropper of BitRat [To complete]
Date: 19/01/2021

## Information
- .NET
- Currently detection: just by 13 Antivirus, no one seems to recognize it as dropper of BitRat
- Detect any.run virtual machine
- Compared with a dropper of FormBook, found some bytes matched, but I'm not sure they are useful, I think are just bytes of normal .NET executable [See Comparison]
