## How it works

I tried different ways to make this plugin work, due to the different ways Gobfuscate loads the encrypted strings, I developed this quick and a bit dirty plugin
to get at least an overview of the sample's capabilities.

Using the decompiler output and some regexs, the plugin parses the encrypted string and key and performs the XOR.

Please note, some strings may be incorrect.
