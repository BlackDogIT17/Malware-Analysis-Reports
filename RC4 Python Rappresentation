s = [31,26,7,10,23,3,20,30,14,4,16,15,29,8,2,9,21,19,11,6,12,17,25,24,0,22,13,27,5,1,28,18] # This will be our array of data

Now let's declare the counters manually:

i = 0

j = 0

Ok, first step is: add one to i:

i += 1

Second step: Add the value of s[i] to j

j = s[i]

Third step: swap the value of s[i] with s[j]:

value_of_i = s[i] # Save the values for the swap

value_of_j = s[j]

s[i] = value_of_j # Swapping the values

s[j] = value_of_i

Let's check the array:

>>> s

[31, 13, 7, 10, 23, 3, 20, 30, 14, 4, 16, 15, 29, 8, 2, 9, 21, 19, 11, 6, 12, 17, 25, 24, 0, 22, 26, 27, 5, 1, 28, 18]

Nice, everything worked, now the fourth and last step: add (s[i] and s[j]) and mod for the length of the array %len(s), so:

index_RC4 = (s[i] + s[j])%len(s)

Check the value:

>>> index_RC4

7

Now let's get the value from the array:

encrypted_value = s[index_RC4]

>>> encrypted_value

30

Nice, everything went fine, you can watch everything I did in this [video](https://youtu.be/NKnZARFAhMk)
