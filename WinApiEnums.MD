| Names         | Value         | Meaning     |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------|
| PROV_RSA_FULL | 0x00000001  |     Supports both digital signatures and data encryption. It is considered a general purpose CSP. The RSA public key algorithm is used for all public key operations.        |
| PROV_DSS      | 0x00000003  |     Supports hashes and digital signatures. The signature algorithm specified by the PROV_DSS provider type is the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).        |
|   PROV_RSA_AES            |    0x00000018         | Supports the same as PROV_RSA_FULL with additional AES encryption capability.
|  PROV_DSS_DH             |      0x0000000D       | A superset of the PROV_DSS provider type with Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
|      PROV_DH_SCHANNEL         |      0x00000012       | Supports both Diffie-Hellman and Schannel protocols.
|        PROV_RSA_SCHANNEL       |       0x0000000C      | Supports both RSA and Schannel protocols.
|      PROV_MS_EXCHANGE         |       0x00000005      | Designed for the cryptographic needs of the Exchange mail application and other applications compatible with Microsoft Mail.
