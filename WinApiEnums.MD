| PROV_RSA_FULL | 0x00000001  |     Supports both digital signatures and data encryption. It is considered a general purpose CSP. The RSA public key algorithm is used for all public key operations.        |
| PROV_DSS      | 0x00000003  |     Supports hashes and digital signatures. The signature algorithm specified by the PROV_DSS provider type is the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).        |
|   PROV_RSA_AES            |    0x00000018         | Supports the same as PROV_RSA_FULL with additional AES encryption capability.
|  PROV_DSS_DH             |      0x0000000D       | A superset of the PROV_DSS provider type with Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
|      PROV_DH_SCHANNEL         |      0x00000012       | Supports both Diffie-Hellman and Schannel protocols.
|        PROV_RSA_SCHANNEL       |       0x0000000C      | Supports both RSA and Schannel protocols.
|      PROV_MS_EXCHANGE         |       0x00000005      | Designed for the cryptographic needs of the Exchange mail application and other applications compatible with Microsoft Mail.

| CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT | 0xF0000000  |     This option is intended for applications that are using ephemeral keys, or applications that do not require access to persisted private keys, such as applications that perform only [hashing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/h-gly), [encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/e-gly), and [digital signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly) verification. Only applications that create signatures or decrypt messages need access to a private key. In most cases, this flag should be set. For file-based CSPs, when this flag is set, the pszContainer parameter must be set to NULL. The application has no access to the persisted private keys of [public/private key pairs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly). When this flag is set, temporary public/private key pairs can be created, but they are not persisted. For hardware-based CSPs, such as a smart card CSP, if the pszContainer parameter is NULL or blank, this flag implies that no access to any keys is required, and that no UI should be presented to the user. This form is used to connect to the CSP to query its capabilities but not to actually use its keys. If the pszContainer parameter is not NULL and not blank, then this flag implies that access to only the publicly available information within the specified container is required. The CSP should not ask for a PIN. Attempts to access private information (for example, the [CryptSignHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptsignhasha) function) will fail. When CryptAcquireContext is called, many CSPs require input from the owning user before granting access to the private keys in the [key container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecGloss/k-gly). For example, the private keys can be encrypted, requiring a password from the user before they can be used. However, if the CRYPT_VERIFYCONTEXT flag is specified, access to the private keys is not required and the user interface can be bypassed.|
| CRYPT_NEWKEYSET      | 0x00000008  |     Creates a new key container with the name specified by pszContainer. If pszContainer is NULL, a key container with the default name is created.        |
|   CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET            |    0x00000020         | By default, keys and key containers are stored as user keys. For Base Providers, this means that user key containers are stored in the user's profile. A key container created without this flag by an administrator can be accessed only by the user creating the key container and a user with administration privileges.Windows XP:  A key container created without this flag by an administrator can be accessed only by the user creating the key container and the local system account.A key container created without this flag by a user that is not an administrator can be accessed only by the user creating the key container and the local system account.The CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET flag can be combined with all of the other flags to indicate that the key container of interest is a computer key container and the CSP treats it as such. For Base Providers, this means that the keys are stored locally on the computer that created the key container. If a key container is to be a computer container, the CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET flag must be used with all calls to CryptAcquireContext that reference the computer container. The key container created with CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET by an administrator can be accessed only by its creator and by a user with administrator privileges unless access rights to the container are granted using CryptSetProvParam.Windows XP:  The key container created with CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET by an administrator can be accessed only by its creator and by the local system account unless access rights to the container are granted using CryptSetProvParam.The key container created with CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET by a user that is not an administrator can be accessed only by its creator and by the local system account unless access rights to the container are granted using CryptSetProvParam.The CRYPT_MACHINE_KEYSET flag is useful when the user is accessing from a service or user account that did not log on interactively. When key containers are created, most CSPs do not automatically create any public/private key pairs. These keys must be created as a separate step with the CryptGenKey function.
|  CRYPT_DELETEKEYSET             |      0x00000010       | Delete the key container specified by pszContainer. If pszContainer is NULL, the key container with the default name is deleted. All key pairs in the key container are also destroyed.When this flag is set, the value returned in phProv is undefined, and thus, the CryptReleaseContext function need not be called afterward.
|      CRYPT_SILENT         |      0x00000040       | The application requests that the CSP not display any user interface (UI) for this context. If the CSP must display the UI to operate, the call fails and the NTE_SILENT_CONTEXT error code is set as the last error. In addition, if calls are made to CryptGenKey with the CRYPT_USER_PROTECTED flag with a context that has been acquired with the CRYPT_SILENT flag, the calls fail and the CSP sets NTE_SILENT_CONTEXT.CRYPT_SILENT is intended for use with applications for which the UI cannot be displayed by the CSP.
|        CRYPT_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_OPTIONAL       |       0x00000080      | Obtains a context for a smart card CSP that can be used for hashing and symmetric key operations but cannot be used for any operation that requires authentication to a smart card using a PIN. This type of context is most often used to perform operations on an empty smart card, such as setting the PIN by using CryptSetProvParam. This flag can only be used with smart card CSPs.Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  This flag is not supported.
